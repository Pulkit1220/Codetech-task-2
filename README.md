## 📌 Project Title
**Singly Linked List Implementation in C**

---

## 📖 Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **singly linked list** in C programming.  
It supports basic operations such as:
- Insertion at the beginning
- Insertion at the end
- Deletion of a node by value
- Traversal (displaying all nodes)

This project helps understand **dynamic memory allocation** and the use of **pointers** in C.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Modular and efficient implementation  
- Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc()` and `free()`  
- Menu-driven program for easy execution  
- Proper memory cleanup before exit
